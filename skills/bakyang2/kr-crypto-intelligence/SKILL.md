## Data Privacy & What Gets Sent

**The server requires only the tool call parameters listed below. What your MCP client actually transmits depends on the client implementation — please review your MCP client's privacy and transport settings to verify.**

Specifically, each tool requires:
- `get_kimchi_premium`, `get_global_vs_korea_divergence`, `get_global_vs_korea_divergence_deep`: `symbol` parameter only (e.g., "BTC")
- `get_kr_prices`: `symbol` and `exchange` parameters only
- `get_arbitrage_scanner`, `get_exchange_alerts`, `get_market_movers`: no parameters — server computes from cached exchange data
- `get_market_read`: no parameters — server fetches all data internally and runs AI analysis server-side
- `get_kr_sentiment`: no parameters — server combines exchange data with Korean news context and runs AI sentiment analysis server-side
- `get_fx_rate`, `get_stablecoin_premium`, `get_available_symbols`, `check_health`: no parameters

Note: Like any HTTP service, the server receives standard HTTP metadata (IP address, user-agent) as part of normal network communication.

**Network calls only to:** `mcp.printmoneylab.com` and `api.printmoneylab.com`

## Payment Authorization (x402 Protocol)

**How x402 payment works — step by step:**

1. Agent calls a paid endpoint (e.g., `get_kimchi_premium`)
2. Server returns HTTP 402 with price in the `payment-required` header
3. **The MCP client or platform decides whether to pay** — this is NOT automatic
4. If the client approves, it signs a USDC transfer for the exact amount on Base, Polygon, or Solana
5. Client retries with payment proof in `X-PAYMENT` header
6. Server verifies payment and returns data

**Key points:**
- **Payment is NOT automatic.** The agent's MCP client (e.g., xpay Smart Proxy, Claude, Cursor) controls whether to authorize payment.
- **No wallet keys or credentials are stored in this skill.** Payment is handled entirely by the MCP client's x402 transport layer.
- **The skill cannot charge without explicit client-side authorization.** The x402 protocol requires a cryptographic signature from the buyer's wallet.
- **Cost per call:** $0.001 (basic data) to $0.10 (AI deep analysis). No subscriptions, no hidden fees.

## Autonomous Invocation Advisory

This skill is designed to be invoked by the agent when the user asks about Korean crypto markets. If your platform supports invocation controls:
- **Recommended:** Set to "user-invoked only" until comfortable with billing behavior
- **Budget:** Configure your MCP client's spending limit
- **Maximum cost per session:** Bounded by your client's spending policy

## Security

- **No local code execution** — instruction-only skill
- **No credentials stored** — no API keys, no wallet keys, no env vars
- **No file system access** — all data from remote API
