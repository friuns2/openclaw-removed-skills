## Data Output Formats

### Format 1: Structured & Curated Data
Pre-processed, cleaned, and organized data ready for analysis:
```json
{
  "summary": "Key insights extracted from raw data",
  "structured_data": {
    "field1": "value1",
    "field2": "value2"
  },
  "trends": [...],
  "recommendations": [...]
}

```

Format 2: Raw API JSON
Original, unmodified JSON response from the underlying API:
```json
{
  "source": "original-api-name",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "raw_response": { ... }
}
```

Format 3: Markdown Report
Human-readable report format for consumption and sharing:

# Data Report: Topic X

## Summary
Key findings and insights...

## Detailed Data
Structured presentation of results...

## Sources
List of data sources used...

## Data Processing Capabilities
All queries benefit from the following built-in capabilities:

## Capability	Description
Filtering	Filter data by date range, category, location, value thresholds, and custom criteria
Validation	Automatic data quality checks, duplicate removal, format verification
Deduplication	Remove duplicate entries across multiple data sources
Transformation	Convert between formats, normalize values, currency/unit conversion
Enrichment	Cross-reference with other datasets to add context
Aggregation	Summarize, group, and calculate statistics across datasets
Natural Language Filtering Examples
Users can specify filters directly in their query:

*"Show me e-commerce products with rating above 4.5 and price under $50"*

"Get job listings in San Francisco posted in the last 7 days"

"Find trending social media posts with over 10k likes from this week"

"Show Web3 projects with at least $1M TVL and active in the last 30 days"

"Get sports results for Premier League matches from January 2024 onwards"

*"Filter for only verified local service providers with 4+ star ratings"*

## Core Capabilities
| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Natural Language Queries | Convert user's natural language into API calls with automatic parameter extraction |
| Async Result Polling | Automatically poll until data is ready |
| API Supply Addition | Add new API supplies using natural language + documentation link |
| Data Bounties | Initiate data bounties when requested data is unavailable |
| Multi-Format Output | Return structured data, raw JSON, or Markdown reports |
| Data Processing | Built-in filtering, validation, deduplication, and transformation |

## When to Use

User wants structured/pre-processed data, not just raw API responses

User needs data filtering, validation, or cross-source enrichment

User wants to add a new API supply to the system

User cannot find desired data and wants to offer a bounty

## When NOT to Use
Local file read/write operations

Pure computation tasks (no external data needed)

Scenarios requiring sub-second real-time responses

General knowledge questions not related to the supported data domains

Prerequisites: Getting an API Key
Before using this Skill, you need a DataHub API Key. Two ways to get one:

Option 1: Apply via Website
Visit DataHub official website: https://seekin.chat

Register or log in to your account

Navigate to "API Management" or "Developer" page

Create a new API Key and copy it

Option 2: Get it Directly in Chat
Visit https://seekin.chat

Simply type in the website's chat dialog:

text
Please give me an API Key
or

text
I want to apply for an API key
The system will automatically generate and return an API Key

💡 Tip: New users typically receive free credits sufficient for daily use.

Configuring the API Key
After obtaining your API Key, configure it using one of these methods:

Method A: Environment Variable (Recommended)

bash
export DATAHUB_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
Method B: User Config File
Create ~/.datahub/config.json:

json
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
}
Method C: Project Config File
Create datahub.config.json in your project root:

json
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
}
Configuration priority: Environment Variable > User Config > Project Config

## Workflows
### Workflow 1: Standard Data Query
Use this when the user wants to fetch data from any supported domain.

Step 1: Submit Query
Execute scripts/query.js to submit the user's natural language query:

bash
node scripts/query.js "<user's natural language query>" [sessionId]
Parameters:

First argument: User's natural language query (required)

Second argument: Session ID for context retention (optional)

Response Format:

json
{
  "success": true,
  "processId": "xxx-xxx-xxx",
  "message": "Query submitted"
}
Step 2: Poll for Results
Execute scripts/poll.js to poll for the processed result:

bash
node scripts/poll.js <processId> [--max-attempts 60] [--interval 1000]
Parameters:

processId: Process ID returned from Step 1 (required)

--max-attempts: Maximum polling attempts, default 60

--interval: Polling interval in milliseconds, default 1000

Response Format:

json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "attempts": 5,
  "elapsed": 5234
}
Step 3: Parse and Present Results
If structured JSON returned: Present key insights clearly with appropriate formatting

If raw JSON returned: Present the data with source attribution; offer to further process if needed

If Markdown returned: Maintain the formatted report as-is for readability

If query fails: Explain possible reasons and suggest alternatives (including data bounties)

### Workflow 2: Adding an API Supply
Use this when the user wants to add a new API supply to the system. The user provides a natural language description and a documentation link.

Step 1: Submit API Supply Addition
Execute scripts/query.js with a specially formatted query that includes the API documentation link:

bash
node scripts/query.js "Add API supply: <description>. Documentation: <DocLink>" [sessionId]
Examples:

bash
# E-commerce API
node scripts/query.js "Add API supply: Amazon product search and reviews API. Documentation: https://api.example.com/docs"

# Social Media API
node scripts/query.js "Add API supply: LinkedIn company page data API. Docs: https://linkedin-api.example.com"

# Web3 API
node scripts/query.js "Supply a DEX trading volume API for Uniswap and PancakeSwap: https://defi-api.example.com/docs"
Alternative Natural Language Formats:

"I want to add a new API for job board data. Docs: https://jobs-api.example.com"

"Register new data source for esports match results: https://esports-api.example.com"

"Add supply: Short video trending data from TikTok. DocLink: https://tiktok-api.example.com"

Step 2: Poll for Confirmation
Execute scripts/poll.js with the returned processId:

bash
node scripts/poll.js <processId>
Expected Response:

json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "apiId": "new-api-xxx",
    "domain": "e-commerce",
    "status": "registered",
    "message": "API supply successfully added and pending approval"
  }
}

Step 3: Confirm to User
Inform the user that:

The API supply has been submitted and categorized under the appropriate domain

It will be reviewed and activated shortly

They can start using it once approved

### Workflow 3: Creating a Data Bounty
Use this when the user requests data that is not currently available, and they want to offer a reward/bounty for it.

Step 1: Submit Data Bounty
Execute scripts/query.js with a query describing the desired data and bounty details:

bash
node scripts/query.js "Create data bounty: <data description>. Reward: <bounty details>" [sessionId]
Examples:

bash
# E-commerce data bounty
node scripts/query.js "Create data bounty: I need Amazon Best Seller rankings updated daily for the electronics category. Reward: $100"

# Recruitment data bounty
node scripts/query.js "Bounty: Looking for LinkedIn job posting data with salary info across tech companies. Will pay $200"

# Gaming data bounty
node scripts/query.js "I need real-time player statistics for Valorant competitive matches. Offering $150 bounty"
Alternative Natural Language Formats:

"I need data on short video trends by region but can't find it. Can I create a bounty?"

"Offer reward for marketing campaign performance data across platforms"

"Start a bounty for Web3 developer activity metrics. Reward: $500"

"The education dataset I want isn't available. How can I request it with a bounty?"

Step 2: Poll for Bounty Creation Confirmation
Execute scripts/poll.js with the returned processId:

bash
node scripts/poll.js <processId>
Expected Response:

json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "bountyId": "bounty-xxx-xxx",
    "status": "active",
    "domain": "gaming",
    "description": "Real-time player statistics for Valorant competitive matches",
    "reward": "$150",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "message": "Bounty created successfully"
  }
}
Step 3: Inform User
Provide the user with:

Bounty ID for tracking

Confirmation that the bounty is now active

The domain it was categorized under

Estimated timeframe (if available)

How they can check bounty status later

Error Handling
Error Type	Handling Approach
API Key not configured	Guide user to visit https://seekin.chat to obtain an API Key
Invalid/Expired API Key	Prompt user to refresh their API Key or verify it's correct
Query timeout	Retry up to 3 times with incremental backoff
Polling timeout	Inform user the task is taking longer; suggest checking back later
Invalid response format	Attempt to extract useful information; otherwise report format issue
Network error	Prompt user to check network connection
Insufficient credits	Direct user to website to check balance and upgrade options
API supply already exists	Inform user the API is already available and can be used immediately
Bounty creation failed	Explain reason and suggest adjusting reward or description
Data not found (bounty eligible)	Proactively suggest creating a data bounty
Domain not supported	Suggest creating a bounty or API supply to add the domain
Filter too restrictive	Suggest broadening filter criteria and retry
Proactive Suggestions
The Skill should proactively suggest:

Data processing options: "Would you like this data filtered, validated, or returned as raw JSON?"

When data is unavailable: "This data isn't currently available. Would you like to create a bounty for it?"

When user mentions an API: "Would you like to add this as an API supply? Just provide the documentation link."

Domain expansion: "I notice you're requesting data from [domain]. If we don't have it yet, I can help you create a bounty or API supply."

Format preference: "I can return this as structured data, raw JSON, or a Markdown report. Which do you prefer?"

After successful API supply addition: "Your API supply has been submitted and categorized. You can check its status later with the API ID."

When bounty is created: "Your bounty is now active. You'll be notified when someone fulfills it."

## Configuration Reference
Variable	Description	Default
DATAHUB_API_KEY	Required, obtain from https://seekin.chat	None
DATAHUB_BASE_URL	DataHub API base URL	https://seekin.chat
DATAHUB_TIMEOUT	Request timeout in milliseconds	60000

### Important Notes
Each query generates a unique processId for result retrieval
Results typically take 3-30 seconds; complex queries may take longer
Use sessionId to maintain context across multi-turn conversations
Scripts use only Node.js built-in modules — no additional dependencies required
First-time users must obtain an API Key from https://seekin.chat
API supply additions require a valid documentation link (DocLink)
Data bounties remain active until fulfilled or cancelled
All three operations (query, supply, bounty) use the same API endpoint structure
Data can be returned as structured/curated data OR raw API JSON — specify your preference
All data queries support filtering, validation, and deduplication
