  convert still images into animated video clips with this skill. Works with JPG, PNG, WEBP, HEIC files up to 200MB. social media creators use it for converting static images into shareable video content — processing takes 30-60 seconds on cloud GPUs and you get 1080p MP4 files.

## Getting Started

> Share your still images and I'll get started on AI video creation. Or just tell me what you're thinking.

**Try saying:**
- "convert my still images"
- "export 1080p MP4"
- "turn these images into a smooth"

### Getting Connected

Before handling any user request, establish a connection to the backend API. Show a brief status like "Connecting...".

**If `NEMO_TOKEN` is in the environment**, use it directly and create a session. Otherwise, acquire a free starter token:
- Generate a UUID as client identifier
- POST to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/auth/anonymous-token` with the `X-Client-Id` header
- The response includes a `token` with 100 free credits valid for 7 days — use it as NEMO_TOKEN

**Then create a session** by POSTing to `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` with Bearer authorization and body `{"task_name":"project","language":"en"}`. The `session_id` in the response is needed for all following requests.

Tell the user you're ready. Keep the technical details out of the chat.

# AI Image to Video EaseMate — Convert Images into Videos

Drop your still images in the chat and tell me what you need. I'll handle the AI video creation on cloud GPUs — you don't need anything installed locally.

Here's a typical use: you send a three product photos in JPG format, ask for turn these images into a smooth video with transitions and background music, and about 30-60 seconds later you've got a MP4 file ready to download. The whole thing runs at 1080p by default.

One thing worth knowing — using fewer images per video speeds up processing time noticeably.

## Matching Input to Actions

User prompts referencing ai image to video easemate, aspect ratio, text overlays, or audio tracks get routed to the corresponding action via keyword and intent classification.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## Cloud Render Pipeline Details

Each export job queues on a cloud GPU node that composites video layers, applies platform-spec compression (H.264, up to 1080x1920), and returns a download URL within 30-90 seconds. The session token carries render job IDs, so closing the tab before completion orphans the job.

Base URL: `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai`

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent` | POST | Start a new editing session. Body: `{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}`. Returns `session_id`. |
| `/run_sse` | POST | Send a user message. Body includes `app_name`, `session_id`, `new_message`. Stream response with `Accept: text/event-stream`. Timeout: 15 min. |
| `/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>` | POST | Upload a file (multipart) or URL. |
| `/api/credits/balance/simple` | GET | Check remaining credits (`available`, `frozen`, `total`). |
| `/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest` | GET | Fetch current timeline state (`draft`, `video_infos`, `generated_media`). |
| `/api/render/proxy/lambda` | POST | Start export. Body: `{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}`. Poll status every 30s. |

Accepted file types: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

Headers are derived from this file's YAML frontmatter. `X-Skill-Source` is `ai-image-to-video-easemate`, `X-Skill-Version` comes from the `version` field, and `X-Skill-Platform` is detected from the install path (`~/.clawhub/` = `clawhub`, `~/.cursor/skills/` = `cursor`, otherwise `unknown`).

Include `Authorization: Bearer <NEMO_TOKEN>` and all attribution headers on every request — omitting them triggers a 402 on export.

### Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Bad/expired token | Re-auth via anonymous-token (tokens expire after 7 days) |
| 1002 | Session not found | New session §3.0 |
| 2001 | No credits | Anonymous: show registration URL with `?bind=<id>` (get `<id>` from create-session or state response when needed). Registered: "Top up credits in your account" |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show supported formats |
| 4002 | File too large | Suggest compress/trim |
| 400 | Missing X-Client-Id | Generate Client-Id and retry (see §1) |
| 402 | Free plan export blocked | Subscription tier issue, NOT credits. "Register or upgrade your plan to unlock export." |
| 429 | Rate limit (1 token/client/7 days) | Retry in 30s once |

### Reading the SSE Stream

Text events go straight to the user (after GUI translation). Tool calls stay internal. Heartbeats and empty `data:` lines mean the backend is still working — show "⏳ Still working..." every 2 minutes.

About 30% of edit operations close the stream without any text. When that happens, poll `/api/state` to confirm the timeline changed, then tell the user what was updated.

### Translating GUI Instructions

The backend responds as if there's a visual interface. Map its instructions to API calls:

- "click" or "点击" → execute the action via the relevant endpoint
- "open" or "打开" → query session state to get the data
- "drag/drop" or "拖拽" → send the edit command through SSE
- "preview in timeline" → show a text summary of current tracks
- "Export" or "导出" → run the export workflow

Draft JSON uses short keys: `t` for tracks, `tt` for track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg` for segments, `d` for duration in ms, `m` for metadata.

Example timeline summary:
```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

## Tips and Tricks

The backend processes faster when you're specific. Instead of "make it look better", try "turn these images into a smooth video with transitions and background music" — concrete instructions get better results.

Max file size is 200MB. Stick to JPG, PNG, WEBP, HEIC for the smoothest experience.

Export as MP4 for widest compatibility across platforms and devices.

## Common Workflows

**Quick edit**: Upload → "turn these images into a smooth video with transitions and background music" → Download MP4. Takes 30-60 seconds for a 30-second clip.

**Batch style**: Upload multiple files in one session. Process them one by one with different instructions. Each gets its own render.

**Iterative**: Start with a rough cut, preview the result, then refine. The session keeps your timeline state so you can keep tweaking.
