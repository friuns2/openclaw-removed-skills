## [Unreleased]

_No unreleased changes._

## [1.3.4] — 2026-04-22

Diagnostics and hygiene roll-up. No breaking changes; upgrade with `clawhub update antenna`.

Highlights:
- `antenna bundle verify <file>` — inspect a bootstrap bundle before importing (REF-2000).
- `antenna doctor` gains three new audits: self-peer URL shape (REF-2001), peer-state drift section 1b (REF-2002), and on-disk secrets hygiene section 6b (REF-2003).
- `antenna peers remove` now prunes peer-scoped allowlist entries (REF-1312); peer endpoint URLs validated at every ingress path (REF-1313).

### Added
- **REF-2000 — `antenna bundle verify <file>`.** New read-only CLI command for sanity-checking a received `.age.txt` bootstrap bundle before running `antenna peers exchange import`. Decrypts in place, validates shape / endpoint URL / freshness, and prints a safe summary — the hooks token and identity secret never appear in human or `--json` output, only `has_hooks_token` / `has_identity_secret` presence booleans. Never writes to `antenna-peers.json` or `antenna-config.json`. Supports `--json`, `--force-expired`, and `--no-decrypt`. A new shared `lib/bundles.sh` backs both this command and `antenna peers exchange import`, so both paths agree on what "valid" means; import error messages are now more specific as a side effect (e.g. `schema_version must be 1 (got: 2)`).
  Docs impact: bundle_verification

### Fixed
- **REF-1312 — `antenna peers remove` now prunes peer-scoped allowlist entries.** When a peer is removed, its entries in `allowed_inbound_peers`, `allowed_outbound_peers`, and any peer-scoped inbound session allowlists are also pruned so stale allowlist debris (the `nexus` / `bruce` class of leftover) doesn't accumulate. Peer secret material is intentionally left in place; secret deletion remains an explicit operator action.
  Docs impact: peer_remove_allowlist_pruning
- **REF-1313 — peer endpoint URLs are validated at every ingress path.** `antenna peers add`, `antenna setup`, `antenna peers exchange export`, and `antenna peers exchange import` now reject non-HTTPS / malformed URLs (e.g. bare strings like `main`, `localhost` without a scheme) rather than silently accepting them and corrupting peer state downstream.
  Docs impact: peer_url_validation
- **REF-2001 — `antenna doctor` now validates the self-peer URL shape.** A malformed self-peer `url` (for example a legacy `"main"` value) is now a doctor failure rather than silently passing. Malformed non-self peer URLs are reported as warnings rather than failures so existing paired peers don't break operations. A self-marked peer missing `url` entirely is also surfaced as a distinct failure.
  Docs impact: doctor_url_validation
- **REF-2002 — `antenna doctor` now audits peer-state drift.** New section `1b. Peer-State Drift` audits the three peer-scoped allowlists in `antenna-config.json` (`allowed_inbound_peers`, `allowed_outbound_peers`, peer-scoped inbound sessions) against `antenna-peers.json`. Orphan peer IDs (allowlist entries for peers that no longer exist) surface as warnings, never failures. Catches the `nexus` / `bruce`-era debris class automatically and complements the REF-1312 pruning at peer removal time.
  Docs impact: doctor_peer_state_drift
- **REF-2003 — `antenna doctor` now audits on-disk secrets hygiene.** New section `6b. Secrets Directory Hygiene` audits the live `secrets/` directory: orphan peer-scoped secret / token files whose peer IDs are no longer in `antenna-peers.json` (the file-side counterpart to REF-1312 / 1b), backup-pattern leftovers (`.bak*`, `.backup*`, `~`, `.old`), loose `secrets/` directory permissions (target `700`), loose per-file permissions on secret-shaped files (target `600`), and unknown-shape files inside `secrets/`. All findings surface as warnings, never failures, so a peer removal that leaves stale secret files on disk does not break the health check while still getting visible attention.
  Docs impact: doctor_secrets_hygiene

### Docs
- Sync `SKILL.md` and `references/USER-GUIDE.md` with the REF-1312 / REF-1313 / REF-2002 entries above so the health-and-status and troubleshooting sections match shipped behavior before publish.
  Docs impact: continuity_sync

## [1.3.3] — 2026-04-21

### Docs
- **Revert 1.3.2 README-header tweak.** Post-publish investigation confirmed ClawHub's skill-page "README" tab always renders `SKILL.md`, not `README.md`; the 1.3.2 H1-to-blockquote change had no effect on the rendered page and was made on a false premise. Restored the original `# 🦞 Antenna — Cross-Host Messaging for OpenClaw` heading and bold tagline. No runtime changes.
  Docs impact: readme_header_revert

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-21

### Docs
- **Attempted README rendering fix for ClawHub (did not take effect).** Removed the `# H1` heading from the top of `README.md` and moved the project tagline into a blockquote, on the theory that ClawHub's skill-page "README" tab was falling back to `SKILL.md` when `README.md` opened with a competing H1. Later verification showed ClawHub's "README" tab renders `SKILL.md` regardless of `README.md`'s heading style, so this change was ineffective and is reverted in 1.3.3.
  Docs impact: readme_rendering

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Changelog slimmed down.** Pre-`1.3.0` entries moved to `references/CHANGELOG-HISTORY.md`. The current file covers `[Unreleased]` plus the most recent releases; full history lives on GitHub and in the history file.
  Docs impact: changelog_layout
- **Registry bundle trimmed.** Added `.clawhubignore` so internal review/QA documents and historical drafts stay in the git repo but are no longer shipped to the ClawHub registry. Specifically excluded: `references/ANTV4-PHASE-1-REVIEW.md`, `references/ANTV4-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md`, `references/ANTV4-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST-SHORT.md`, `references/copy-draft-v1.2.0.md`, `references/issues.md`, `references/setup-completion-v1.1.8.md`, `references/GAPS.md`.
  Docs impact: registry_bundle_contents

### Docs
- README "Version" section updated to reflect the current published release and to point at the in-repo full-history changelog.
  Docs impact: version_number

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-20

### Security
- **REF-603 — plaintext bootstrap bundle JSON could leak in `/tmp` on failure.** `scripts/antenna-exchange.sh` now streams outbound bootstrap JSON directly from `jq` into `age` instead of writing a plaintext temp file first, and the import path installs cleanup traps immediately after decrypt so decrypted plaintext JSON is removed on normal return, validation failure, or signal interruption.
  Docs impact: bootstrap_bundle_handling
- **REF-400 — envelope-marker collisions could smuggle fake headers.** `scripts/antenna-relay.sh` now rejects any message whose body or sanitized header values contain `[ANTENNA_RELAY]` or `[/ANTENNA_RELAY]`, logging `status:MALFORMED (marker in body|headers)`. Sender (`antenna-send.sh`) also guards against injecting markers outbound.
- **REF-402 — no timestamp freshness check on inbound messages.** Relay now validates `timestamp:` against a freshness window (default: max 300s old, 60s future skew), configurable via `.security.max_message_age_seconds` / `.security.max_future_skew_seconds`. Rejected lines carry `nonce:` for correlation, consistent with REF-1501.
- **REF-403 (partial) — plaintext auth envelope persisted on receiver disk.** Relay temp files (`antenna-relay-exec.sh`, `antenna-relay-file.sh`) are now created under `umask 077`, `chmod 0600`'d, and `shred`'d-before-unlink on cleanup (best-effort, falls back to truncate+rm). The `/tmp/antenna-relay` parent dir is tightened to `0700` when owned. Full REF-403 (removing `auth:` from the wire) remains tracked alongside REF-402 HMAC work.
- **REF-404 — self-id fell back to `$(hostname)` if config was missing.** `antenna-send.sh` now fails fast with a clear error instead of silently using the machine hostname as a peer identity, preventing accidental cross-host identity collisions.
- **REF-501 — auth comparison was not constant-time.** Relay-side peer-secret comparison now uses a constant-time path to eliminate timing side-channels on secret verification.
- **REF-601 — expired bundle import succeeded silently.** `antenna-exchange.sh` import path now validates bundle expiry and refuses expired material with a clear error, covered by `tests/ref-601-expired-bundle-refusal.sh`.
- **REF-616 — exchange-bundle emails sent with bogus `antenna@localhost` From address.** `scripts/antenna-exchange.sh` now resolves sender email from the Himalaya TOML config at `${HIMALAYA_CONFIG:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/himalaya/config.toml}`. Both `send_bundle_email` and `send_pubkey_email` hard-fail if the account's email cannot be resolved. Interactive flows use selection-only confirmation through `confirm_from_account`. `--account <name>` remains supported as strict selection of a configured account.
  Docs impact: exchange_email_from_resolution

### Fixed
- **REF-300 / REF-303 — `antenna peers add` silently overwrote existing entries and null-ed out un-supplied fields.** `cmd_peers add` now refuses to touch an existing peer unless `--force` is given, and `--force` applies merge semantics: only fields explicitly supplied on the command line are overwritten, everything else (including unknown top-level fields like `.self` set by peer-exchange) is preserved.
  Docs impact: peers_add_overwrite_policy, peer_registry_merge_semantics
- **REF-604 — `ensure_peer_entry_updated()` lost unknown peer-entry fields:** jq merge switched from `+` to `*` so nested peer fields (including `.self`) are preserved additively during peer updates.
  Docs impact: peer_registry_merge_semantics
- **REF-605 — legacy identity-secret export could leak over non-TTY stdout:** `legacy_export_runtime_secret()` now refuses to print the runtime identity secret when stdout is not a TTY and points operators at Layer A encrypted bootstrap instead.
  Docs impact: identity_secret_handling
- **REF-901 — setup could silently overwrite gateway `hooks.token`:** `scripts/antenna-setup.sh` now preserves an existing gateway `hooks.token` and only writes from Antenna's token file when the gateway value is absent or already matches.
  Docs impact: gateway_hooks_token_setup
- **REF-903 — setup reruns silently stripped operator `tools.exec` policy from the antenna agent:** the existing-agent repair path in `scripts/antenna-setup.sh` no longer does `del(.exec)`, so expert `tools.exec` overrides survive reruns. Setup still forces `sandbox.mode = "off"` and seeds the default deny list only when `tools.deny` is absent.
  Docs impact: setup_agent_update_behavior
- **REF-1206c — pair wizard no longer falsely implies bootstrap email delivery succeeded.** `scripts/antenna-pair.sh` now checks the real exit status from `antenna peers exchange initiate ... --send-email`, treats non-zero send attempts as failures, tells the operator the bundle was not sent, and falls back to explicit manual-delivery acknowledgement instead of fake-success wording.
  Docs impact: pair_wizard_email_delivery_behavior
- **REF-1501 — poll-loop couldn't fast-fail on auth/peer/rate-limit REJECTED:** `scripts/antenna-relay.sh` now tags all post-body REJECTED log lines with `nonce:$NONCE`. Combined with REF-1502, `antenna test <model>` now exits on the first nonce-scoped REJECTED instead of waiting for `--timeout`.
  Docs impact: model_test_behavior
- **REF-1502 — `TEST_NONCE` generated but not used for log correlation:** `scripts/antenna-model-test.sh` now polls for nonce-scoped PASS and nonce-scoped REJECTED instead of session-only matching, so concurrent runs can't cross-poison each other's results.
  Docs impact: model_test_behavior
- **REF-1504 — model-test swap bypassed gateway sync:** `scripts/antenna-model-test.sh` now swaps and restores `relay_agent_model` through `antenna config set ... --no-restart` (which also updates the antenna agent's `.model` in `openclaw.json`). Gateway is bounced exactly once after the initial swap and once in the cleanup trap, instead of per-run.
  Docs impact: model_test_behavior

### Added
- **`--no-restart` flag on `antenna config set` and `antenna model set`** for rapid-batch callers that want to write gateway config now and restart the gateway once at the end. Internal helper `_sync_relay_model_to_gateway` split into `_write_relay_model_to_gateway_config` (no restart) and `_restart_gateway`.
  Docs impact: model_test_behavior

### Changed
- **Test-suite provider request compatibility and fixture freshness refresh.** `scripts/antenna-test-suite.sh` now sends OpenAI-family requests with `max_completion_tokens`, Anthropic requests with `max_tokens`, and uses a fresh current UTC timestamp in Tier A.15 so the REF-500 regression once again exercises session-target rejection instead of tripping freshness validation first. Fresh validation evidence now includes clean full-suite runs for `openai/gpt-5.4-nano`, `openai/gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`, and `google/gemini-2.5-pro`.
  Docs impact: test_suite_behavior, relay_model_recommendation
- **Recommended relay model updated to `openai/gpt-5.4-nano`.** Operator-facing docs and config examples now present `openai/gpt-5.4-nano` as the recommended relay model on speed/fit grounds.
  Docs impact: relay_model_recommendation, version_number

### Docs
- README version/status refreshed for the `v1.3.0` release, SKILL metadata includes canonical repository/homepage URLs for provenance, and operator-facing docs/config examples now present `openai/gpt-5.4-nano` as the recommended relay model.
  Docs impact: version_number, relay_model_recommendation

## [1.2.22] — 2026-04-20

### Note
- Historical/prepared release waypoint retained for continuity. Its substantive fixes were rolled into the `1.3.0` release narrative above.

## [1.2.21] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Session resolution: sender no longer injects its own default session into outbound envelopes.** When `--session` is omitted, `target_session` is omitted from the envelope entirely; the recipient resolves from their own `default_target_session` config. Sender no longer needs to know the recipient's internal session layout. (Issue #17)
  Docs impact: session_resolution, version_number
