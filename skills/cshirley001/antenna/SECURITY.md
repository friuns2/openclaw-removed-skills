# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Antenna, **please report it privately** rather than opening a public GitHub issue.

**Email:** [help@clawreef.io](mailto:help@clawreef.io)

Include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- The version of Antenna you're running
- Any relevant logs or configuration (redact secrets)

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation within 7 days for critical issues.

## Scope

This policy covers the Antenna skill itself — scripts, relay protocol, trust model, and configuration handling. For vulnerabilities in OpenClaw core, please report to the [OpenClaw project](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) directly.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 1.3.0 (prepared next release) / current `main` | ✅ Current |
| 1.2.21 - 1.2.22 (prepared interim release docs) | ⚠️  Historical release narrative only; upgrade to 1.3.0 when published |
| 1.2.20 | ⚠️  Upgrade recommended (important post-release hardening landed after this tag) |
| 1.2.0 – 1.2.19 | ⚠️  Upgrade strongly recommended (concurrency / security hardening landed after these) |
| < 1.2 | ❌ Unsupported |

Important security-sensitive work landed after `1.2.20` and is now being rolled into the prepared `1.3.0` release, with `1.2.21` and `1.2.22` retained as internal release-history waypoints rather than the next planned public publish. That includes envelope-marker guard (REF-400), message freshness window (REF-402), relay temp-file hygiene (REF-403), self-id fallback removal (REF-404), constant-time identity-secret compare (REF-501), expired-bundle refusal (REF-601), plaintext bootstrap-bundle cleanup (REF-603), Himalaya `From:`-address resolution (REF-616), legacy raw-secret export non-TTY refusal (REF-605), gateway `hooks.token` preservation on setup rerun (REF-901), and operator `tools.exec` preservation on setup rerun (REF-903).

## Security-Relevant Design

Antenna's full security model is documented in the [Relay Protocol FSD](references/ANTENNA-RELAY-FSD.md), the [User Guide](references/USER-GUIDE.md), and the [SKILL.md Trust Model](SKILL.md#trust-model). The following commitments are load-bearing and in scope for vulnerability reports:

- **Script-first relay —** the relay agent is a courier that runs deterministic bash scripts. All envelope parsing, validation, formatting, and logging is done by `scripts/antenna-relay.sh` and friends. The LLM never parses, encodes, transforms, or modifies relayed content.
- **Layered trust —** HTTPS transport, hook bearer token, per-peer identity secret (constant-time compared), peer allowlists (inbound and outbound), session allowlist (full keys only), envelope-marker guard, message-freshness window, rate limiting, and log sanitization.
- **Layer A encrypted bootstrap —** peer onboarding uses `age`. Export streams bundle JSON directly into `age` with no plaintext temp file. Import decrypts to a temp file that is cleaned up on every exit path (normal return, validation failure, preview failure, write failure, `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`). Expired bundles are refused by default; `--force-expired` is the disaster-recovery override. Legacy raw-secret export refuses non-TTY stdout.
- **Read-only bundle verification —** `antenna bundle verify <file>` decrypts a received bootstrap bundle in place and validates shape / endpoint URL / freshness without touching `antenna-peers.json` or `antenna-config.json`. Human and `--json` output never print the raw hooks token or identity secret, only presence booleans. Shared validation logic in `lib/bundles.sh` keeps `bundle verify` and `peers exchange import` in agreement on what "valid" means.
- **Self-identity is mandatory —** the sender refuses to run without `self_id` configured. There is no `$(hostname)` fallback.
- **Concurrency safety —** unique per-message relay temp files under `/tmp/antenna-relay/` (`umask 077`, `chmod 0600`, shredded before `unlink`), `flock`-based transaction locking around inbox and rate-limit state mutations.
- **Setup is idempotent and conservative —** `antenna setup` reruns preserve an existing gateway `hooks.token` and preserve any operator-customized `tools.exec` overrides on the Antenna agent. Operators will not silently lose trust material by rerunning setup after a `clawhub update`.

## Known Security Considerations

These are openly acknowledged trade-offs and limitations of the current design. They are **not** vulnerabilities — they are intentional boundaries. Reports that rediscover them will be politely closed.

- **Sandbox off on the relay agent.** The Antenna agent runs with `sandbox: { mode: "off" }` because OpenClaw sandboxing silently clamps session visibility to `tree`, which breaks cross-agent `sessions_send`. The mitigations are: a restrictive `tools.deny` list on the agent (blocking web, browser, image, cron, memory tools), peer authentication via per-peer identity secret, peer and session allowlists, rate limiting, envelope-marker and freshness guards, and the script-first relay design that keeps the LLM out of the content path. Default advice is also **not** to set `tools.exec.security` or `tools.exec.ask` on the Antenna agent — explicit exec overrides have been shown to cause silent relay failure. Operators who intentionally customize `tools.exec` are on their own trust boundary; setup reruns now preserve those overrides (REF-903) so we don't clobber an informed choice.
- **Secrets at rest.** Hooks tokens and per-peer runtime identity secrets are stored as plaintext files with `chmod 600`. No encryption at rest. `antenna status` audits permissions and flags anything looser than `600`. If your host filesystem is untrusted, Antenna is not the right transport.
- **Email is convenience transport only.** The optional `--send-email` path for bootstrap bundles and public keys uses Himalaya to deliver already-encrypted (`age`) artifacts. Email is not part of the trust model; a compromised email account cannot impersonate a peer or read bundle contents without the recipient's `age` private key.
- **ClawReef is a discovery surface, not a trust broker.** ClawReef stores endpoints, exchange public keys, and — if you pair with the reef — your hooks token and identity secret so it can deliver invites and verify your identity (standard webhook-provider behavior). ClawReef does not store messages, private age keys, or message content. All peer-trust decisions happen locally in Antenna.
- **Untrusted input framing is advisory.** Relayed content is framed with a security notice so receiving agents treat it as external input, but enforcement ultimately depends on the receiving agent's own behavior. This is why the relay-agent itself is kept deliberately thin and non-interpreting.

For deeper architectural detail, see [`references/ANTENNA-RELAY-FSD.md`](references/ANTENNA-RELAY-FSD.md) and the historical security assessments in `docs/` (repo-only, not shipped with the skill).

## Out of Scope

The following are not Antenna vulnerabilities and should be reported elsewhere:

- Issues in OpenClaw core (gateway, agent runtime, session delivery) → [OpenClaw repo](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
- Issues in ClawReef discovery / registry → `help@clawreef.io` with subject prefix `[ClawReef]`
- Issues in `age` / `age-keygen`, `himalaya`, `jq`, `curl`, `openssl`, `flock` → respective upstream projects
- Host-level compromise of a peer (e.g. an attacker with shell on your laptop) — Antenna's trust model assumes the local host is trusted by its operator
