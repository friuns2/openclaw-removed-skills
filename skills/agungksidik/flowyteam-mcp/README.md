## What is FlowyTeam?

[FlowyTeam](https://flowyteam.com) is an all-in-one SaaS platform for team productivity and performance management — OKRs, KPIs, projects, HR, CRM, finance, and more. Trusted by 7,000+ organizations across 140+ countries.

---

## What does this MCP do?

This skill connects Claude Code (or any MCP client) to your FlowyTeam workspace via a remote HTTP MCP server. Once connected, you can manage your entire workspace through natural language — no need to open the app.

**34 tools. Full CRUD. No extra software required.**

---

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/mcp/gateway` | None required | **Gateway** — public endpoint; exposes `auth_register`, `auth_verify_email` & `auth_login` plus all authenticated tools (token passed per-call in header) |
| `POST /api/v2/mcp/rpc` | Bearer token | **RPC** — authenticated endpoint; all 31 workspace tools |

Use the **Gateway** if you want a single URL for everything (bootstrap + use).
Use the **RPC** endpoint if you already have a token.

## Install via ClawhHub

The easiest way to add FlowyTeam MCP is directly from [ClawhHub](https://clawhub.ai/agungksidik/flowyteam-mcp):

```bash
# Install from ClawhHub registry
clawhub install agungksidik/flowyteam-mcp
```

Or add manually using the steps below.

---

## Quick Start

### Option A — You already have an account & token

#### 1. Get your API Token

Log in to FlowyTeam → **Settings → MCP & AI Integration** → Copy your token.

#### 2. Connect with Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add flowyteam \
  --transport http \
  --url https://flowyteam.com/api/v2/mcp/rpc \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

#### 3. Or use Claude Desktop / Cursor

Add this to your `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowyteam": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "https://flowyteam.com/api/v2/mcp/rpc",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Option B — Existing account, no token configured

Connect to the Gateway and ask Claude to login with your credentials.

#### 1. Connect to the Gateway without a token

```bash
claude mcp add flowyteam \
  --transport http \
  --url https://flowyteam.com/api/mcp/gateway
```

#### 2. Ask Claude to login

```
"Login to FlowyTeam with email alice@acme.com and password secret123"
```

Claude calls `auth_login` → returns `api_token`. Then reconnect using Option A with that token.

---

### Option C — New account via Gateway

If MCP registration is enabled on the platform, you can create an account directly from the CLI.

#### 1. Connect to the Gateway and register

```
"Register a new FlowyTeam account — company Acme Corp, name Alice Smith,
 email alice@acme.com, password secret123"
```

Claude calls `auth_register` → a verification email is sent to your address.

#### 2. Verify your email (choose one path)

**Path A — paste code to CLI (fastest):**
Open the verification email, copy the code from the link URL
(e.g. for `.../email-verification/ABC123XYZ` the code is `ABC123XYZ`), then tell Claude:

```
"Verify my email with code ABC123XYZ"
```

Claude calls `auth_verify_email` → returns `api_token` immediately.

**Path B — click link in browser:**
Click the verification link in the email to activate via the web, then tell Claude:

```
"Login to FlowyTeam with email alice@acme.com and password secret123"
```

Claude calls `auth_login` → returns `api_token`.

#### 3. Reconnect with the token

```bash
claude mcp add flowyteam \
  --transport http \
  --url https://flowyteam.com/api/v2/mcp/rpc \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

#### 4. Full access — 34 tools available

```
"Create a task 'Review Q2 Report' in Marketing project, assign to Sarah, due April 30"
"Show me all open high-priority tickets"
"Who is on leave this week?"
"What are our company OKRs for Q2 2026?"
"Log 8 hours on the Mobile App project for today"
"Create an invoice for Acme Corp, total $5,000, due May 31"
```

## Tools (34)

### Authentication Tools (public — no token required)

| 3 | `auth_login` | Login with email + password (for existing or newly web-verified accounts). Returns `api_token` for use as Bearer token. | POST |

## How It Works

This MCP uses **Streamable HTTP transport (JSON-RPC 2.0)**. Every workspace tool accepts a `method` parameter to select the operation:

| `method` | Operation |
|---|---|
| `GET` | Read / list records |
| `POST` | Create a new record |
| `PUT` | Update an existing record |
| `DELETE` | Delete a record |

Auth tools (`auth_register`, `auth_verify_email`, `auth_login`) only support `POST` and do not require a `method` field.

### Gateway vs RPC

```
Gateway  POST /api/mcp/gateway           ← single URL for everything
  ├── initialize / tools/list            ← no auth needed
  ├── auth_register                      ← no auth needed (creates account, sends verification email)
  ├── auth_verify_email                  ← no auth needed (activates account, returns api_token)
  ├── auth_login                         ← no auth needed (returns api_token)
  └── all workspace tools                ← reads Bearer token from header

RPC      POST /api/v2/mcp/rpc            ← authenticated only
  └── all workspace tools                ← requires Bearer token (middleware)
```

## Smart Features

Several tools support **name-based resolution** — you don't need to look up IDs manually:

- `department` — lookup by `name` string (auto-finds the ID for PUT/DELETE)
- `invoices` — lookup by `invoice_number` (e.g. `INV#0001`)
- `estimates` — lookup by `estimate_number` (e.g. `EST#0003`)
- `contracts` — lookup by `subject` (partial match)
- `events` — lookup by `event_name` (partial match)
- `expenses` — lookup by `item_name` (partial match)
- `timelogs` — resolve `project_name` → ID, `task_name` → ID, `employee_name` → ID
- `timelogs` PUT — without `id`, finds the currently running timer automatically

## Permissions

| Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Full read/write access to all tools |
| **Employee** | Read + self-service (own tasks, attendance, leave, expenses, time logs) |

Some modules (`invoices`, `estimates`, `contracts`, `events`, `expenses`, `notices`, `timelogs`) require the corresponding module to be enabled in your FlowyTeam plan.

---

## Security (Gateway)

The Gateway endpoint applies the following protections:

| Layer | Details |
|---|---|
| **Rate limiting** | 60 requests/minute per IP (throttle:60,1) |
| **Suspicious input check** | Blocks bot-like names and company names |
| **Duplicate email check** | Prevents duplicate account creation |
| **Email verification** | New accounts start as inactive — must be verified via `auth_verify_email` or web link before use |
| **SuperAdmin notification** | Every new MCP registration triggers an email to all SuperAdmins |
| **Platform toggle** | `allow_mcp_registration` must be enabled by SuperAdmin (default: off) |
